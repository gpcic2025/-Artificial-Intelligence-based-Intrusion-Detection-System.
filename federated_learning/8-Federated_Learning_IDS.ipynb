Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Evaluation of weights-updated model on Client 41: Accuracy 0.4500\n","\n","--- End of FederatedClient Model Management Test ---\n","\n","✅ Section 4 (FederatedClient Class - Part 3: Model Management & Evaluation) is ready.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Imports from Section 1 should still be in effect.\n","# FederatedClient class from Sections 2, 3, 4 should be defined.\n","# Ensure all necessary modules like os, np, pd, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, train_test_split,\n","# Adam, Sequential, LSTM, Dense, Dropout, EarlyStopping, datetime are available from previous cells or Section 1.\n","\n","class FederatedClient:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Represents a client (edge device) in the federated learning system.\n","    Each client has its own local data and model.\n","    (Includes methods from Part 1, 2, 3 and this correction)\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def __init__(self, client_id, data=None, model=None):\n","        self.client_id = client_id\n","        self.data = data\n","        self.model = model\n","        self.history = []\n","        # print(f\"Client {self.client_id}: Initialized.\")\n","\n","    def load_data(self, data_path=None, partition_identifier=None, total_partitions=1):\n","        if data_path and os.path.exists(data_path):\n","            try:\n","                if data_path.endswith('.csv'): full_data_df = pd.read_csv(data_path, low_memory=False)\n","                elif data_path.endswith(('.json', '.jsonl')): full_data_df = pd.read_json(data_path, lines=data_path.endswith('.jsonl'))\n","                else: raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported file format: {data_path}\")\n","\n","                if partition_identifier is not None and total_partitions > 0 and total_partitions <= len(full_data_df):\n","                    if not (0 <= partition_identifier < total_partitions): raise ValueError(\"partition_identifier out of range.\")\n","                    num_samples_total = len(full_data_df)\n","                    samples_per_partition = num_samples_total // total_partitions\n","                    start_idx = partition_identifier * samples_per_partition\n","                    end_idx = (partition_identifier + 1) * samples_per_partition if partition_identifier < total_partitions - 1 else num_samples_total\n","                    self.data = full_data_df.iloc[start_idx:end_idx].copy()\n","                else:\n","                    self.data = full_data_df\n","                return True\n","            except Exception as e:\n","                print(f\"Client {self.client_id}: Error loading data from '{data_path}': {e}\");
